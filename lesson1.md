# Software repository
Many software publishers and other organizations maintain servers on the Internet for this purpose, either free of charge 
or for a subscription fee. Repositories may be solely for particular programs, such as CPAN for the Perl programming language, 
or for an entire operating system. Operators of such repositories typically provide a package management system, tools intended
to search for, install and otherwise manipulate software packages from the repositories. For example, many Linux distributions 
use Advanced Packaging Tool (APT), commonly found in Debian based distributions, or yum found in Red Hat based distributions. 
There are also multiple independent package management systems, such as pacman, used in Arch Linux and equo, found in Sabayon Linux.

# Version Control
A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control,[1] is the 
management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually 
identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial 
set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated 
with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.
